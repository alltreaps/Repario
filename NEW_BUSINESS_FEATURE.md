# Multi-Tenant Business Creation Feature

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the "Create a new business" toggle functionality in the LoginPage component with the following features:

## âœ… Implementation Details

### 1. Toggle Switch

- Added a visually appealing toggle switch with proper styling
- Toggle allows users to choose between "Join existing business" and "Create new business"
- Includes helpful descriptive text and icons

### 2. Conditional Form Fields

- **Create New Business Mode**: Shows `businessName` input field, hides `businessId`
- **Join Existing Business Mode**: Shows `businessId` input field, hides `businessName`
- Proper validation for both scenarios using separate Zod schemas

### 3. New Business Creation Flow

When "Create a new business" is checked:

1. User fills out: email, password, fullName, phone, businessName
2. After `auth.signUp()`, a new row is inserted into `public.businesses` table
3. The new business captures `name` and `created_by` (user ID)
4. User profile is created with `business_id` from the new business and `role='admin'`
5. User is automatically signed in

### 4. Business ID Display & Copy Feature

- After successful business creation, shows a success message
- Displays the generated Business ID in a copy-friendly format
- One-click copy to clipboard functionality with visual feedback
- Important instructions for sharing the ID with team members
- "Continue to Dashboard" button to proceed

### 5. Enhanced User Experience

- Updated button text to reflect current mode ("Create Business" vs "Join Business")
- Dynamic header text based on selected mode
- Proper error handling and validation for both flows
- Smooth transitions and visual feedback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Updated Components

- **LoginPage.tsx**: Complete multi-tenant business creation functionality
