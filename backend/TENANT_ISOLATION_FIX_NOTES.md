# Fixed: Secure Tenant Isolation SQL Script

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `column "business_id" does not exist` when trying to create RLS policies for `invoice_items` table.

## Root Cause  
The script incorrectly assumed all tenant tables have a `business_id` column. However, some child tables inherit business context through parent table relationships:

- `invoice_items` → inherits via `invoice_id` → `invoices.business_id`
- `layout_sections` → inherits via `layout_id` → `layouts.business_id`  
- `layout_fields` → inherits via `section_id` → `layout_sections.layout_id` → `layouts.business_id`
- `layout_field_options` → inherits via `field_id` → `layout_fields.section_id` → `layout_sections.layout_id` → `layouts.business_id`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Direct business_id Tables (Auto-Assignment)
Tables with their own `business_id` column get triggers:
- ✅ `items` - trigger + simple RLS policies
- ✅ `customers` - trigger + simple RLS policies  
- ✅ `invoices` - trigger + simple RLS policies
- ✅ `layouts` - trigger + simple RLS policies

### 2. Child Tables (Relationship-Based)
Tables without `business_id` get JOIN-based RLS policies:
- ✅ `invoice_items` - policies check via `invoices` table
- ✅ `layout_sections` - policies check via `layouts` table
- ✅ `layout_fields` - policies check via `layout_sections` → `layouts`
- ✅ `layout_field_options` - policies check via `layout_fields` → `layout_sections` → `layouts`

### 3. Policy Examples

**Direct business_id table (items):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "write:same-biz:manager+" ON public.items FOR INSERT
TO authenticated WITH CHECK (public.is_manager());
-- business_id auto-assigned by trigger
```

**Child table (invoice_items):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "write:via-invoice:manager+" ON public.invoice_items FOR INSERT
TO authenticated WITH CHECK (
  public.is_manager() AND
  EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.invoices 
         WHERE invoices.id = invoice_items.invoice_id 
         AND invoices.business_id = public.current_business_id())
);
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Proper Architecture**: Respects the existing database design and relationships
2. **No Schema Changes**: Doesn't require adding unnecessary `business_id` columns to child tables
3. **Referential Integrity**: Child tables stay properly linked to their parents
4. **Performance**: Uses existing foreign key indexes for JOIN operations
5. **Security**: Maintains tenant isolation through relationship chains

## Files Updated
- ✅ `backend/secure-tenant-isolation-fix.sql` - Fixed to handle both direct and relationship-based isolation
- ✅ Removed incorrect triggers for child tables
- ✅ Added proper JOIN-based RLS policies for child tables
- ✅ Updated verification queries

The script is now ready to run without errors and will provide comprehensive tenant isolation for all table types.
