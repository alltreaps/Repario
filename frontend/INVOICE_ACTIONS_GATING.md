## Permission Matrix Updated

Added new `invoices.export` ability to the permission matrix:

```typescript
// New ability type
export type Ability = 
  | 'invoices.export'  // ← Added this
  | // ... other abilities

// Updated matrix
const matrix: Record<Role, Ability[]> = {
  admin: [
    'invoices.view', 'invoices.create', 'invoices.edit', 'invoices.delete', 'invoices.export',
    // ... other permissions
  ],
  manager: [
    'invoices.view', 'invoices.create', 'invoices.edit', 'invoices.export',
    // ... other permissions  
  ],
  user: [
    'invoices.view', 'invoices.create',
    // ... other permissions (no edit, delete, or export)
  ]
};
```

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts`**:

   - Added `invoices.export` to admin and manager roles

2. **`frontend/src/components/InvoiceHistoryPage.tsx`**:
   - Wrapped Export All button with `<ActionIf ability="invoices.export">`
   - Verified all other actions are properly gated (they were already correct)

## Result

🎯 **Complete permission-based access control** for all invoice actions, ensuring users only see and can use features appropriate to their role level. The interface will automatically hide unavailable actions based on the user's permissions, providing a clean and secure user experience.
