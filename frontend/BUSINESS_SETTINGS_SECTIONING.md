# Business Settings Page Sectioning - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The BusinessSettingsPage has been completely restructured with granular permission-based sections:

## Section Breakdown

### 1. Business Profile Section - Manager+ (`business.edit`)
**Access**: Managers and Admins
**Content**:
- Business name, email, phone, address
- Tax ID/EIN 
- Currency and timezone settings
- **Gated with**: `<Can ability="business.edit">`
- **Form disabled if**: User lacks `business.edit` permission
- **Submit disabled if**: User lacks permission OR form is saving

### 2. WhatsApp Templates Section - Manager+ (`business.edit`)
**Access**: Managers and Admins  
**Content**:
- Pre-configured message templates

- Template editing interface
- **Gated with**: `<Can ability="business.edit">`
- **Form disabled if**: User lacks `business.edit` permission
- **Submit disabled if**: User lacks permission OR form is saving

### 3. Status Messages Section - Manager+ (`business.edit`)

### 4. Danger Zone Section - Admin Only (`business.delete`, `business.transfer`)

**Content**:
- Transfer Ownership (requires `business.transfer`)
- Delete Business (requires `business.delete`)
- **Gated with**: `<Can ability="business.delete">`
- **Buttons disabled if**: User lacks specific permissions

## Permission Matrix Updated

Added new business-related abilities:

```typescript
export type Ability = 
  | 'business.edit'       // ← Manager+ can edit business profile/templates/status
  | 'business.delete'     // ← Admin only can delete business  
  | 'business.transfer'   // ← Admin only can transfer ownership
  | // ... other abilities

const matrix: Record<Role, Ability[]> = {
  admin: [
    // ... other permissions
    'business.edit', 'business.delete', 'business.transfer'
  ],
  manager: [
    // ... other permissions  
    'business.edit'
  ],
  user: [
    // ... other permissions (no business access)
  ]
};
```

## Security Implementation

### ✅ Section-Level Gating
Each section uses `<Can ability="...">` wrapper:
- Shows fallback message if user lacks permission
- Hides entire section content from unauthorized users

### ✅ Form Field Disabling  
All form inputs have `disabled={!can('business.edit')}`:
- Visual indication of read-only state
- Prevents form manipulation by unauthorized users

### ✅ Submit Button Protection
All submit buttons check permissions:
```tsx
disabled={!can('business.edit') || savingProfile}
```

### ✅ Individual Action Protection
Danger zone actions check specific abilities:
- Transfer button: `disabled={!can('business.transfer')}`
- Delete button: `disabled={!can('business.delete')}`

## User Experience by Role

| Section | User | Manager | Admin |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| Business Profile | 🚫 Fallback message | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| WhatsApp Templates | 🚫 Fallback message | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| Status Messages | 🚫 Fallback message | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| Danger Zone | 🚫 Fallback message | 🚫 Fallback message | ✅ Full access |
